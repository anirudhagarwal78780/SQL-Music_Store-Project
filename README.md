# SQL-Music_Store-Project


SQL Music Store Data Analysis
This project involves querying a music store database using SQL to extract insights and perform data analysis. The project demonstrates the use of key SQL concepts such as:

JOINS: To combine data across multiple tables.
WHERE: For filtering records based on specific conditions.
HAVING: To filter groups after aggregation.
ORDER BY: To sort the results by one or more columns.
The queries help in exploring various aspects of the music store, such as customer purchase patterns, sales by artist or genre, and overall store performance.
